      "faq1": {
        "question": "How effective are condoms?",
        "answer": "Condoms are about 98% effective when used correctly every time. They also protect against STIs including HIV. Use a new condom for every sexual act."
      },
      "faq2": {
        "question": "Can I get pregnant during my period?",
        "answer": "Yes, though less likely. Sperm can live in the body for up to 5 days, so if you have a short cycle, pregnancy is possible. Use protection consistently."
      },
      "faq3": {
        "question": "How do I know if I have an STI?",
        "answer": "Many STIs have no symptoms. Common signs include unusual discharge, sores, pain during urination, or itching. Get tested regularly if sexually active."
      },
      "faq4": {
        "question": "Is HIV curable?",
        "answer": "HIV is not curable, but it is treatable. Antiretroviral therapy (ARVs) allows people with HIV to live long, healthy lives. With treatment, viral load can become undetectable."
      },
      "faq5": {
        "question": "What is consent?",
        "answer": "Consent is clear, voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. It must be freely given, can be withdrawn anytime, and silence or \"maybe\" is not consent."
      },
      "faq6": {
        "question": "Where can I get free condoms?",
        "answer": "Free condoms are available at government health facilities, PPAG clinics, youth-friendly centers, and some NGO offices across Ghana."
      },
      "faq7": {
        "question": "How can I manage stress?",
        "answer": "Healthy stress management includes: regular exercise, adequate sleep, talking to someone you trust, deep breathing exercises, and engaging in hobbies you enjoy."
      },
      "faq8": {
        "question": "What should I do if I'm feeling suicidal?",
        "answer": "Call a crisis hotline immediately (Suicide Prevention: 0800234567). Talk to a trusted adult, counselor, or healthcare provider. You are not alone, and help is available."
      },
      "faq9": {
        "question": "Can I get the morning-after pill without prescription?",
        "answer": "Yes, emergency contraception (Postinor-2, Plan B) is available over-the-counter at pharmacies in Ghana. Most effective within 72 hours of unprotected sex."
      },
